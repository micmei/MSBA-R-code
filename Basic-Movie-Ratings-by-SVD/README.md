This was an assignment for Intro to Business Data Analytics with Professor Pradeep Ravikumar.

A basic Singular Value Decomposition approach to approximate words frequency matrix and Latent Semantic Indexing(LSI) approach to respond to a query with the most similar documents.

The most interesting part of this assignment, for me, was the visualization of projected vectors for terms and for documents. This gave us a good sense of the similarity among existing documents.
