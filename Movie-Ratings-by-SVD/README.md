This was the term project for Introduction to Business Data Analytics taught by Professor Pradeep Ravikumar. I teamead up with Ambuj Agarwal to finish the project.

The data was collected through the MovieLens web site(movielens.umn.edu) during the seven-month period from September 19th, 1997 through April 22nd, 1998, which was done by the GroupLens Research Project (http://grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/). 

The team proposes a model to approximate the rating matrix based on Singular Value Decomposition (SVD). Missing values account for around 94% of the matrix and we fitted them based on matrix random segmentation with means of column, means of row and means of matrix. 

I was responsible for the first part, which was importing the data and exploring insights from data.
